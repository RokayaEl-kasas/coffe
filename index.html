        <h4>It is believed that the drink was named mainly after the Mocha Bean, a type of coffee bean that was shipped
            from the Mocha Port in Yemen. Mocha beans were known and famous for their natural chocolate flavor. Now the
            name "Mocha" no longer refers to this type of coffee bean, but rather to the presence of chocolate flavors
            added to the coffee drink.</h4>
